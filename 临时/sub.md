when i use archlinux to build the project,I had some problems building files with cmake. I've solved it, but I guess the problem is general.(at least in archlinux).

After executing `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .`, the error is reported as followsï¼š

```bash

I found a similar problem in google: https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues/2151, after understanding, I found that one of the solutions is to put the CMakeLIsts.txt file The `cereal` in lines 113, 117, 132, and 136 is changed to `cereal::cereal`, but there may be a better solution, what do you think?

I'm not quite sure what the question means, but I guess it's at least helpful to the project.
